            <p class="panel-text">While many advertised ‘health bars’ contain surprising amounts of added sugar (in some cases, more than chocolate bars!), Superfoodies only contain genuinely nutritious, raw and natural ingredients. Superfoodies are gluten free, dairy free and do not contain cholesterol or added sugar. They are also low in sodium and a good source of fibre – not to mention extremely delicious. </p>
