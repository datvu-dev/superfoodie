            <p class="panel-text">Superfoods are a special category of 
            all-natural foods that are nutrient-rich and calorie-sparse by definition. The 'super' in their name is likely attributed to their widely recognised beneficial properties for health and wellbeing. As for the ‘food’ part… we might let you figure that out for yourself.</p>
            <p class="panel-text">Superfoodies have been categorised into ‘breakfast’ and ‘all day’ slices. Both varieties are jam-packed with enough sustenance and nutrients to keep you full and energised for the day ahead. Our tropical blend of coconut, walnut, chia and banana, for example, is intended for breakfast… but we won’t tell anyone if you bend the rules.</p>
